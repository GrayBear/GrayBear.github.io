    <h2>Which Javascript Function is Better</h2>

    <h3>There is only one way to find out... FIGHT</h3>

    <p>Just for a bit of fun I have put together a number of tests to see what is the most efficient way to code in Javascript.</p>

    <p>By no means should my conclusion change your patterns as many factors determine what approach you should take</p>

    <h2>Tests</h2>
